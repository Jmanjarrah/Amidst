# Welcome

Welcome to the AMIDST wiki! This is a collection of various documents to aid in
the usage of the "Advanced Minecraft Interface and Data/Structure Tracking"
program - aka AMIDST.

## FAQ

A lot of questions pop up over and over, this section is here to answer some of
the common ones.

### Showing dungeons

...

### Village/temple/witch hut/stronghold/spawn point is not where AMIDST says it is!

...

### What colour is the biome I'm looking for?

Some of the good AMIDST users have made a [biome colour legend](biomecolors.md).
Note that in AMIDST 3.5 and onwards you will be able to define your own biome
colours, e.g., to make one particular biome stand out more.

## Usage help

To avoid problems, be sure to specifically check the Minecraft profile you wish
to use for AMIDST's biome map rendering. Don't use the "(Default)" profile.

Note that AMIDST cannot currently read biomes from saved worlds, so if you have
a world/map from e.g. pre-1.7 and try to render it with a Minecraft 1.7 profile,
your already explored chunks will be shown in AMIDST as if they'd been generated
with 1.7.

## Usage permissions

AMIDST comes with absolutely *no* warranty. It is licenced under the
[GNU General Public License version 2](https://bitbucket.org/skiphs/amidst/raw/master/LICENSE.txt),
